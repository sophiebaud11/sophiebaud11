## Hello! 😊

#### 📝
My name is Sophie, and I'm a senior at Harvard studying History & Literature, Government, and Mandarin Chinese. I'm passionate about combining creative and analytic skills to tell compelling stories!

#### 🧰 
My favorite tools are R, Shiny, [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sophie.bauder#!/), Figma, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including [D3.js](https://observablehq.com/@sophiebaud11)).

#### ✅
I recently finished three data storytelling projects:
1. [A Shiny app modeling data about COVID-19's impact on public education in the United States](https://sophie-bauder.shinyapps.io/COVID19-and-Education/).
2. [A website analyzing audio from performances of Hamlet's famous "To Be or Not To Be" soliloquy](https://sophiebaud11.github.io/tobeornottobe_public/).
3. [A website visualizing the complex landscape of teacher pay in the U.S.](https://sophiebaud11.github.io/teacher-pay/)
