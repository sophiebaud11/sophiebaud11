## Hello! 😊

#### 📝
My name is Sophie, and I'm a senior at Harvard studying History & Literature, Government, and Mandarin Chinese. I'm passionate about combining creative and analytic skills to tell compelling stories!

#### 🧰 
My favorite tools are R, Shiny, Tableau, Figma, and HTML/CSS/Javascript.

#### 🌱  
I'm currently working on three data storytelling projects: 
1. A website visualizing the complex landscape of teacher pay in the U.S.
2. A Shiny app uncovering insights about COVID-19's impact on education.
3. A website analyzing audio from performances of Hamlet's famous "To Be or Not to Be" soliloquy.
