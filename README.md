# Hello! 😊

## My name is Sophie, and I'm a senior at Harvard studying History & Literature, Government, and Mandarin Chinese.

### I'm passionate about combining creative and analytic skills to tell compelling stories.

🧰  My favorite tools are R, Shiny, Tableau, Figma, and HTML/CSS/Javascript.

🌱  I'm currently working on three data storytelling projects: a website visualizing the complex landscape of teacher pay in the U.S, a Shiny app uncovering insights about COVID-19's impact on education, and a website analyzing audio from performances of Hamlet's famous "To Be or Not to Be" soliloquy.
